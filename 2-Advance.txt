1 - Interactive Rebase
- It allows us to manipulate our commit history.

- change commit's message
- delete commits
- reorder commmits
- combine multiple commits into one
- edit/split an existing commit into multiple new ones

USECASE: 
If we have done developing into our feature branch, then we can clean up the commit
structure of the feature branch before merging it into team branch(develop).

For editing in the code editor
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"

Steps :-
1. Choose range of commits (choose base commit).

Application :-
1. Changing commit message
- We can use commit id or we can count the number of commits from HEAD
- Always choose one commit extra from the commit that we are going to edit.

Eg: 
Suppose, we want to change demon commit

33c2939 (HEAD -> master) bug fixes -- HEAD
4e0ce59 (origin/test-4, origin/master, test-4) demon  -- HEAD - 1
b9f45bd Merge branch 'test-3' -- HEAD - 2

// command
git rebase -i HEAD~2

Then use the tool on screen


2 - Cherry Picking 
- It allows us to pick specific commit from other branch

Steps: 
1. Switch to the branch on which we want that commit.
2. git cherry-pick ca1f3ca


3 - To delete the commit from the branch (local)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git reset --hard ca1f3ca
We can undo it with use of Reflog

4 - Reflog
- A protocol of HEAD pointer movement.
- It gives all the logs of actions which we are doing
- Main usecase of this is to undo the code by using commit hashes,
  we can create new branches using the hashes just before mistake.
git reflog

5 - Submodules
- It is standard git repo which is nested inside another(parent) repo.
- If we want to setup version control for external library inside our project we can use it.
git submodule add <repo-url>
- When we clone project normally, submodule doesn't get cloned automatically.
git submodule update --init --


6 - Search & Find
we can search & find commit from cmd line. Check it out
1. Dates --before / --after
2. commit msgs --grep
3. author --author
4. with filename -- <filename>
5. by branch <branch-A>..<branch-B>
